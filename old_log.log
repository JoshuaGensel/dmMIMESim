|     BUGFIX: The double mutants were counted twice -> only look at double mutants for this were pos1 < pos2. Also increased M (amount of viruses). Instead of 4 Million, now 12 Million, and a higher mutation rate: 0.003, instead of 0.001. Utils: the species to id routine is extended for q > 2. But should be refactored and put into the DCA folder

|     Deleted downloaded Eigen package, since it's installed in brew. Not using Eigen structures for the results, it's a pain in the ***, and also only a vector is necessary. Mean Field approximation, using a restricted computation of the probabilites from the PLM function (up to 3 mutations allowed) works. Next step: Using the MF computation and implement the classic MIME approach and write the results.

|     computation of E and h for the direct couplings, so far using a vector of vector of valarrays, better refactoring into Matrix of Eigen since this is used anyway for the matrix inversion of the mean field approximation, one fix to make it fast (in case it happens again): creating the matrix with Eigen, better no auto but the actual strucure, otherwise this structure has to be build everytime it is used-> sloooow; creating testdata to compare with output of R program, so far it works, maybe there is an easier way to compute it instead of all the for loops (calculating h)

|     Long time no commit... a lot of bug fixing.Creation of test data more or less finished. Problem were with very large species id in ints, so using long. if any troubles (because undefined behaveiour) look for that. Also running time was bad, now solved (optimised, could at some parts be even better). Test are working, but should be extended. Nevertheless created 100 test sets with L=400. Documented the test sampling in the thesis. But still some ToDos. filesystem is not working although g++8 and c++17. don't know why. instead create directories for output in bash script.

| 
|     Implementing the class for species with the function of converting a species id into the mutated sequences (TODO here: write test is the outcome is the same as in the R script)
|     Implementing Utils: binomial coefficient (n choose k).
|     Implementing a class for general constants: will be faster for Runtime, since some of the constants are the same for all drawn species.
|     R scripts: nothing important, only deleting comments and check whats done where
